# NordVPN on Unifi Dream Machine (Pro)

## Foreword

This repo is forked from [SierraSoftworks/tailscale-udm](https://github.com/SierraSoftworks/tailscale-udm) which allows to use a Tailscale instance on your UDM / UDM Pro. What's cool also is his approach persists even after a reboot of your UDM.

## What is this?

This repo contains the scripts necessary to setup a [NordVPN](https://www.nordvpn.com/) connection on your [Unifi Dream Machine](https://unifi-network.ui.com/dreammachine) (UDM / UDM Pro).
It does so by piggy-backing on the excellent [boostchicken/udm-utilities](https://github.com/boostchicken/udm-utilities)
to provide a persistent service and runs using the OpenVPN service.

## Instructions

  - Go to UDM Home
  - Click "Settings"
  - Click "System"
  - Scroll Down to the bottom of the list
  - Click select "SSH", agree to the license
  - Set a password
